# FTC Union Theme for WordPress

This is a Gutenberg WordPress theme designed for the FTC Union. It is a child of the [Stewart theme developed by Automattic](https://wordpress.org/themes/stewart/). It features a sidebar on desktop and standard header on mobile.

This theme includes the union's branding baked in. Adjustments would need to be made to use this theme for another website.
